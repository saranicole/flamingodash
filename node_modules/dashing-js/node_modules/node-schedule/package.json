  "readme": "node-schedule\n=============\n\nnode-schedule is a flexible both cron-like and not-cron-like job scheduler for Node.js. It allows you to schedule jobs (arbitrary functions) for execution at specific dates, with optional recurrence rules. It only uses a single timer at any given time (rather than reevaluating upcoming jobs every second/minute), and is MIT-licensed (see below).\n\nnode-schedule is for time-based scheduling, not interval-based scheduling. While you can easily bend it to your will, if you only want to do something like \"run this function every 5 minutes\", you'll find `setInterval` much easier to use, and far more appropriate. But if you want to, say, \"run this function at the :20 and :50 of every hour on the third Tuesday of every month,\" you'll find that node-schedule suits your needs better. Additionally, node-schedule has Windows support unlike true cron since the node runtime is now fully supported.\n\nNote that node-schedule is designed for in-process scheduling, i.e. scheduled jobs will only fire as long as your script is running, and the schedule will disappear when execution completes. If you need to schedule jobs that will persist even when your script *isn't* running, consider using the actual [cron](http://unixhelp.ed.ac.uk/CGI/man-cgi?crontab+5).\n\n\nJobs and Scheduling\n-------------------\n\nEvery scheduled job in node-schedule is represented by a `Job` object. You can create jobs manually, then execute the `schedule()` method to apply a schedule, or use the convenience function `scheduleJob()` as demonstrated below.\n\n`Job` objects are `EventEmitter`'s, and emit a `run` event after each execution. They also emit a `scheduled` event each time they're scheduled to run, and a `canceled` event when an invocation is canceled before it's executed (both events receive a JavaScript date object as a parameter). Note that jobs are scheduled the first time immediately, so if you create a job using the `scheduleJob()` convenience method, you'll miss the first `scheduled` event. Also note that `canceled` is the single-L American spelling.\n\n\nDate-based Scheduling\n---------------------\n\nSay you very specifically want a function to execute at 5:30am on December 21, 2012.\n\n```js\nvar schedule = require('node-schedule');\nvar date = new Date(2012, 12, 21, 5, 30, 0);\n\nvar j = schedule.scheduleJob(date, function(){\n\tconsole.log('The world is going to end today.');\n});\n```\n\nYou can invalidate the job with the `cancel()` method:\n\n```js\nj.cancel();\n```\n\nTo use current data in the future you can use binding:\n\n```js\nvar schedule = require('node-schedule');\nvar date = new Date(2012, 12, 21, 5, 30, 0);\nvar x = 'Tada!';\nvar j = schedule.scheduleJob(date, function(y){\n\tconsole.log(y);\n}.bind(null,x));\nx = 'Changing Data';\n```\nThis will log 'Tada!' when the scheduled Job runs, rather than 'Changing Data', which x changes to immediately after scheduling.\n\n\n\nRecurrence Rule Scheduling\n--------------------------\n\nYou can build recurrence rules to specify when a job should recur. For instance, consider this rule, which executes the function every hour at 42 minutes after the hour:\n\n```js\nvar schedule = require('node-schedule');\n\nvar rule = new schedule.RecurrenceRule();\nrule.minute = 42;\n\nvar j = schedule.scheduleJob(rule, function(){\n\tconsole.log('The answer to life, the universe, and everything!');\n});\n```\n\nYou can also use arrays to specify a list of acceptable values, and the `Range` object to specify a range of start and end values, with an optional step parameter. For instance, this will print a message on Thursday, Friday, Saturday, and Sunday at 5pm:\n\n```js\nvar rule = new schedule.RecurrenceRule();\nrule.dayOfWeek = [0, new schedule.Range(4, 6)];\nrule.hour = 17;\nrule.minute = 0;\n\nvar j = schedule.scheduleJob(rule, function(){\n\tconsole.log('Today is recognized by Rebecca Black!');\n});\n```\n\nIt's worth noting that the default value of a component of a recurrence rule is `null` (except for seconds, which is 0 for familiarity with cron). If we did not explicitly set `minute` to 0 above, the message would have instead been logged at 5:00pm, 5:01pm, 5:02pm, ..., 5:59pm. Probably not what you want.\n\n### Object Literal Syntax\n\nTo make things a little easier, an object literal syntax is also supported, like in this example which will log a message every Sunday at 2:30pm:\n\n```js\nvar j = schedule.scheduleJob({hour: 14, minute: 30, dayOfWeek: 0}, function(){\n\tconsole.log('Time for tea!');\n});\n```\n\n\nCron-style Scheduling\n---------------------\n\n>The cron format consists of:\n> `[MINUTE] [HOUR] [DAY OF MONTH] [MONTH OF YEAR] [DAY OF WEEK] [YEAR (optional)]` \n\nIf you're a fan of cron, you can instead define your recurrence rules using a syntax similar to what you might write in your crontab. For example, the above examples rewritten using this style:\n\n```js\nvar schedule = require('node-schedule');\n\nvar j = schedule.scheduleJob('42 * * * *', function(){\n\tconsole.log('The answer to life, the universe, and everything!');\n});\n```\n\nAnd:\n\n```js\nvar j = schedule.scheduleJob('0 17 ? * 0,4-6', function(){\n\tconsole.log('Today is recognized by Rebecca Black!');\n});\n```\n\n### Unsupported Cron Features\n\nCurrently, `W` (nearest weekday), `L` (last day of month/week), and `#` (nth weekday of the month) are not supported. Also, in the day-of-week field, 7 is currently not recognized as a legal value for Sunday (use 0). Most other features supported by popular cron implementations should work just fine.\n\nIt is also entirely possible at this point that constructing a cron string that can *only* exist in the past will cause an infinite loop. This is only possible if a year is specified. If the specified year is a number (i.e., not a range), node-schedule will perform a sanity check before attempting to schedule something in the past. [cron-parser](https://github.com/harrisiirak/cron-parser) is used to parse crontab instructions.\n\n\nInstalling\n----------\n\nYou can install using [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/package/node-schedule) in the usual way.\n\n```\nnpm install node-schedule\n```\n\n\nAcknowledgements\n-----------------\n\nThis module was originally developed by [@mattpatt](https://github.com/mattpat) and is now maintained by [@tejasmanohar](https://github.com/tejasmanohar).\n\nThat said, we have a lot of contributors that help this project stay alive!
